3. Analysis and Metrics: Leveraging Excel functions, we analyzed the data to extract meaningful metrics.

4. Visual Representation: The dashboard features charts, graphs, and tables, providing a high-level summary.

5. Purpose: Our goal was to monitor sales performance and enhance work management across platforms.
